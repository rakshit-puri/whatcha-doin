## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or another package manager (yarn, pnpm)
- A Supabase account and project.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd whatcha-doin
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Now, open the `.env` file and add your Supabase project URL and anon key. You can find these in your Supabase project's "API" settings.

    ```env
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.
